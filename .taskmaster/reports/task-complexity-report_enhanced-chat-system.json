		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Enhanced Teaching Strategy",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into subtasks such as modifying the chat response function, implementing strategic questioning logic, and integrating past session references.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves significant changes to the chat function, requiring a deep understanding of strategic questioning and the ability to integrate past session data. Testing will be complex due to the need to ensure accurate implementation of the new strategy."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Develop In-Chat Practice Question Feature",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the task into subtasks like integrating question generation, implementing answer validation, and developing feedback logic.",
			"reasoning": "The task requires integrating new functionality into the chat, including generating questions, validating answers, and providing feedback. Dependencies on task 1 add complexity, and testing will need to cover multiple scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Cross-Sell Suggestions",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for modifying the chat system and integrating cross-sell mappings.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves modifying the chat system to include cross-sell suggestions, which is straightforward but requires careful integration with existing mappings. Testing is relatively simple but must ensure relevance and clickability of suggestions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Struggle Detection System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline subtasks for tracking student performance, implementing detection logic, and integrating booking suggestions.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves implementing logic to detect struggling students, which requires tracking performance metrics and integrating booking suggestions. Dependencies on task 2 add complexity, and testing must simulate various struggle scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Context Fetching",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for updating backend data fetching, integrating context into responses, and testing data accuracy.",
			"reasoning": "Enhancing context fetching involves backend updates and ensuring data is used effectively in chat responses. Dependencies on task 1 increase complexity, and testing must ensure timely and accurate data retrieval."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Session-Based Contextual Responses",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for integrating session data into responses and testing personalization accuracy.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires using session data to personalize responses, which involves integrating AI analysis data. Dependencies on task 5 add complexity, and testing must ensure accurate referencing of past sessions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Add Practice Question UI",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Develop subtasks for creating UI components and implementing progress tracking.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves developing UI components for practice questions, which is relatively straightforward but requires attention to detail in UI design and testing for correct display and tracking."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Add Booking Nudge UI",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline subtasks for designing UI elements and integrating booking logic.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating UI components for booking nudges, which is simple in terms of UI design but requires integration with the struggle detection system. Testing is focused on UI interaction and conditions for display."

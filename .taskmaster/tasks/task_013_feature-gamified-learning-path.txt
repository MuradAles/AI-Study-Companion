# Task ID: 13
# Title: Optimize Map Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the map loads quickly and efficiently on all devices.
# Details:
Optimize map rendering using techniques like lazy loading and image optimization. Test performance on various devices to ensure quick load times.

# Test Strategy:
Measure load times and performance metrics on different devices to ensure the map meets performance requirements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Lazy Loading for Map Tiles [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize map rendering by implementing lazy loading for map tiles.
### Details:
Use Intersection Observer API to load map tiles only when they are in the viewport. This reduces initial load time and improves performance.

## 2. Optimize Map Images for Faster Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Reduce the size of map images to improve loading speed across devices.
### Details:
Compress map images using modern formats like WebP and apply responsive image techniques to serve different sizes based on device.

## 3. Test Map Performance on Multiple Devices [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Ensure map loads efficiently on various devices by conducting performance tests.
### Details:
Use tools like Lighthouse and WebPageTest to evaluate map performance on different devices and network conditions.

# Task ID: 8
# Title: Enforce Sequential Progression
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure students progress through checkpoints sequentially.

Create a function that checks topic completion status and updates checkpoint access accordingly. Ensure that future checkpoints remain locked until all topics in the current checkpoint are mastered.

## 2. Design Testing Scenarios for Progression Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create comprehensive testing scenarios to validate the sequential progression logic.
### Details:
Develop test cases to cover various progression scenarios, including edge cases where topics are completed out of order. Ensure tests validate that checkpoints unlock only when all topics in the current checkpoint are mastered.

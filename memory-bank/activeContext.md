## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **Tech Stack:** React 19 + TypeScript + Vite ✅
2. **Backend:** Firebase Functions (Node.js 18) ✅
3. **AI Provider:** OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-3.5-turbo ✅
4. **State Management:** React Hooks + Context API ✅
5. **Routing:** React Router v7 ✅
6. **Authentication:** Anonymous Auth (dev) → Email (prod) ✅
7. **Deployment:** Firebase Hosting ✅

### Chat System Decisions
1. **Purpose:** Chat is for help and clarification only, NOT for practice questions ✅
2. **Math Support:** KaTeX/LaTeX rendering for math equations in messages ✅
3. **Step-by-Step:** Structured explanations with numbered steps ✅
4. **Persistence:** Conversations stored in Firestore (`conversations` collection), loaded on mount ✅
5. **Context:** Loads last 5 sessions, filters by subject throughout entire conversation ✅
6. **Cross-Sell:** Shows after 3 questions answered in conversation (session-based analysis) ✅
7. **ChatList:** Sidebar component for managing multiple conversations ✅
8. **Layout:** Fixed input at bottom, messages scroll correctly ✅

### Practice System Architecture
1. **Dual Systems:** Shared pool (`questions`) + Per-student items (`practice_items`) ✅
2. **Shared Pool:** LeetCode-style interface, all students can access ✅
3. **Per-Student Items:** Checkpoint system, scheduled questions ✅
4. **Gamification:** Only practice page questions count (both systems) ✅

### Configuration Decisions
- ✅ Environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ Firestore security rules for data isolation
- ✅ Scheduled functions for automation
- ✅ FCM for web notifications
- ✅ Shared question pool (questions collection)

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Before Deployment)
1. ⏳ Add OpenAI API key to `functions/.env`
2. ⏳ Verify VAPID key is configured
3. ⏳ Test chat system end-to-end with real sessions
4. ⏳ Test practice question generation in chat
5. ⏳ Verify cross-sell suggestions appear correctly
6. ⏳ Build application: `npm run build`
7. ⏳ Deploy to Firebase: `firebase deploy`

### Post-Deployment
1. Monitor function logs for errors
2. Track user engagement metrics
3. Optimize AI prompts based on results
4. Add enhanced celebration animations
5. Implement subject selection UI for cross-sell

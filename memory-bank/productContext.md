# Product Context: AI Study Companion

## Why This Product Exists

The AI Study Companion bridges the gap between tutoring sessions, addressing critical retention and engagement problems in the tutoring platform ecosystem.

## Problems We Solve

### 1. Student Churn After Goal Completion
**Problem:** 52% of students leave after achieving their primary goal  
**Solution:** Multi-goal awareness system that proactively suggests new subjects when goals complete, showing students the platform's full value

### 2. Low Engagement Between Sessions
**Problem:** Students forget material between sessions, lose momentum  
**Solution:** AI-generated practice questions scheduled for the day after each session, maintaining engagement and reinforcing learning

### 3. Early Week Drop-off
**Problem:** Students with <3 sessions in first week have poor retention  
**Solution:** Automated detection and notification system that nudges at-risk students to book additional sessions

### 4. Lack of Cross-Subject Awareness
**Problem:** Students don't realize platform can help with multiple subjects  
**Solution:** Visual progress dashboard showing all subjects, with intelligent cross-sell suggestions based on completed goals
